        Generate a small world networx graph on a 2d grid:

        - assume nodes occupy a subset of points on a regular square 2d grid
        - assume adjacency_list is provided specifying the *local* grid connections of nodes; the long range links will
          be automatically added

        .. note:: we let the user specify their own local neighborhood per node instead of using related networkx graph
           implementations

        - the networkx implementation of small-world graphs assume ring topology; but instead we're interested in a grid
          in realistic scenarios
        - the networkx implementation of 2d grid graphs assumes no diagonal edges, whereas we'd like to have the
          ability to get neighbors from a (sub)set of the full neighborhood (of 8 nodes aside from boundary, corner or
          missing nodes)
        - since the user has likely already generated their lat/lon grid, we transfer the burden of neighborhood
          generation to them for now
        - we assume that the grid small-world network's non-local/long-range edges are wired for optimal decentralized
          efficiency, which coincides with most of the real-world small-world network examples
        - that is, the probability p((u,v)) of a an edge from node u to v is given by p(u,v) ~ d(u,v)^-2, where d(u,v)
          is the topological shortest path length (i.e. hop length) between u and v *on the grid*
